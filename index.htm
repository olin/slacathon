            <p class='main-par'>SLAC hosts weekly gatherings in Olin&#39;s library, building community around tutorials, workshops, and group project meetings. In this collaborative environment, students also have the opportunity to connect with and learn from peers. In addition, we put on an annual festival of creativity, SLACFest, which is an all-day event that brings students together in the spirit of creation. Students, faculty, and alumni come together to engage in activities ranging from knitting and communal cooking to robotics and 3D printing.</p>

            <h2>SLACFEST</h2>
            <h3>Coming Friday April 29th, 2016</h3>
            <p class="main-par">Last year, we started the tradition of SLACFest, our annual festival of creativity. Over 300 students, faculty, and alumni all came together for an entire day dedicated to fostering the spirit of creativity at Olin. Workshops ranging from cardboard furniture creation to alumni tech talks to screenprinting were spread out through the day, along with personal projects on the side. The day culminated with a communal dinner created by attendees and project exposition showcasing Olin&#39;s best.</p>
            <p class="main-par">This year, SLACfest is back on April 29th. Stay tuned for details!</p>
